# Simulation Study of Pseudolikelihood Information Criteria for Copula Model Selection

This repository contains the final PDF and R code for the simulation study on copula model selection using different information criteria.

# How to Run the Simulation

To run the full simulation, start with the 'main.R' script.  
All other R files ('explicit_derivatives_xv_CIC.R', 'functions_information_criteria.R', 'simulation_scenario_information_criteria.R') are sourced within 'main.R'.

# Results

All results, tables, and discussion are presented in the file 'PSEUDOLIKELIHOOD_INFORMATION_CRITERIA.pdf'
