# Simulation Results for 5000 Replications

This branch contains the simulation results for a larger number of replications (5000) to align with the study by

L. A. Jordanger and D. Tjøstheim,  
*Model selection of copulas: AIC versus a cross validation copula information criterion*,  
Statist. Probab. Lett. **92** (2014) 249–255,

where 5000 replications are considered.

---

The code used to generate these results is the same as in the `main` branch, with the only difference being that the number of replications is set to 5000 instead of 1000.

Overall, the simulation results appear similar to those obtained with 1000 replications.
